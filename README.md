## @harrytwright/chess-analysis

> WIP

This is a project to understand the usage of [`socket.io`](https://socket.io/) with some chess thrown in. Should
be a simple shared analysis board using [stockfish](https://stockfishchess.org/), maybe in a separate server stack, 
or on the [client](http://github.com/harrytwright/chess-www) itself.

Will be written in node, using both express and [`socket.io`](https://socket.io/). Chess logic will be handled 
by [`chess.js`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/chess.js).
